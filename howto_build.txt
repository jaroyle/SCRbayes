To build the R package, install RTools:
http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/

Make sure it changes your PATH. To verify, open a command prompt
and type: PATH. It should look something like this:
PATH=c:\Rtools\bin;c:\Rtools\perl\bin;c:\Rtools\MinGW\bin;c:\Rtools\MinGW64\bin;C:\ProgramFiles (x86)\MiKTeX 2.8\miktex\bin;C:\Program Files\R\R-2.12.1\bin\x64;ETC...

Move to the scrbook directory using something like:
cd F:\Rpackage-SCR

Now build and install the package by typing:
R CMD build SCRbayes
R CMD INSTALL SCRbayes_0.1-0.tar.gz
