Here are some tips for adding stuff to the package

1) Create a file in the "scrbook/R" directory, say Ch9.R

2) Put some functions in the file

3) Each function needs a help file. Templates can be created using the
prompt(someFunction) function in R. See help(prompt). After you make the help file
template, open it and fill in the details. Then put it in the
"scrbook/man" directory.

4) Now you can build and install the package. See the howto_build.txt
file for details about that.






Adding data instead of functions

1) You can put data in the "scrbook/data" directory. The data can be
in several formats. The easiest is probably a .csv file. For data with
multiple objects, you can create a data file using:

save(list(statespace=obj1, raster=obj2, ch=captureHist, X=trapLocations), file="ch9data.rda")


2) Note that you need help files for the data too. See the
promptData(someDataObject) command for creating a template.
